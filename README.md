This repository contains the complete dataset and a detailed Jupyter notebook encompassing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
 and multiple attempts at training two Machine Learning (ML) models: XGBoost (XGB) and Random Forest (RF). 
These efforts are in response to the requirements set by the Identify Cancer Risk (ICR) competition hosted on Kaggle.

## Purpose of the Project:

The objective of this competition is to predict whether an individual has any of three specified medical conditions. The task involves creating a binary classification system where:
- If an individual is diagnosed with one or more of the three medical conditions, they are classified as Class 1.
- Otherwise, the individual is classified as Class 0.

## Project Structure:

1. Data:

- The repository contains the original dataset provided by the competition organizers.

2. Jupyter Notebook:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): This section involves thorough examination and visualization of the dataset to identify patterns, and correlations, as well as perform some data cleaning. 

- Model Training:

    - XGBoost (XGB) Model: Attempts to train an XGB model, and model evaluation.

    - Random Forest (RF) Model: Efforts to train an RF model, and performance assessment.

## Tools and Techniques Used:
- Python Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib.

- Machine Learning Libraries: scikit-learn and XGBoost for model training and evaluation.
